A SPA which takes user input (number of rows and number of columns), than renders a table accordingly to input data. Each cell has a random number, which can be incremented by clicking on it. Also table has a column on the right side, displaying the total amount of a dedicated row, recalculating accordingly to changes, as well as a row on the bottom displaying average value of the dedicated column. User has an ability to add/delete a row, also to see some additional information when hovering on total amount/regular cells. Created with React JS/TypeScript, MUI 5 as style library, compiled with WebPack.
